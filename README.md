# SimX VR Backpack Tools

This repository contains two useful hardware specifications created by [SimX](https://www.simxar.com) to enable easier use of the HTC Vive Pro with HP Z VR backpacks: a custom power cable, and a plastic mounting board.

These designs are released under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license. You may use these for almost any (including commercial) use, so long as you credit SimX and uphold the license. We consider retaining the SimX logo on the plastic mounting board to be sufficient credit.

## Custom power cable
Unfortunately, HP does not provide a cable that can connect the Vive Pro linkbox to the backpack's power supply at this time. We designed and had manufactured a custom power cable to fit this need (which we use alongside the short USB cable that comes with the Vive Pro and short mDP cable https://goo.gl/NZd3DP).

The specifications for a power cable that will connect the Vive Pro linkbox to an HP Z backpack are:
- Link box side: 3.8mm x 1.35mm Male, 9mm length, inner barrel positive
- Backpack side: 4mm x 1.75mm Male, 11.5mm length, inner barrel positive

## Custom plastic insert
Because HTC does not provide a short cable to connect the Vive Pro HMD to the Vive Pro linkbox (the cable in the wireless adapter kit doesn't work), it's necessary to find a way to manage the long cable (and the linkbox itself) when using a VR backpack. We designed a acrylic insert that fits between the backpack computer and the harness and can be used to mount the linkbox and cables using cable ties (we use velcro ties).

We provide [here](https://github.com/SimX-Inc/VR-Backpack-Tools/blob/master/Insert-LaserCutterDesign-v6.eps?raw=true) a laser cutter design for the plastic insert. This design is intended to be used with two-color laser cutter materials. Blue indicates cut lines, and black indicates etch areas. Velcro ties are used in the thin blue slots to secure the link box and cabling to the insert.

We used impact-modified 1/8" thick 2-ply acrylic laminate sheets to make our inserts. This material provided enough flexiibility to make it easy to put the insert in but was strong enough to resist breakage.
